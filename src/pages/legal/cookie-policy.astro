      <h1>Cookie policy</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: 2026-01-19</em></p>

      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>{siteName}</strong> (“Zenovee,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies
        on our website (the “Site”). For more information about how we handle personal information, see our
        <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device by a website. They help websites function, remember preferences, and (if enabled)
        measure how the site is used. Similar technologies include local storage, pixels, SDKs, and device identifiers.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
      <p>We may use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strictly necessary:</strong> required to deliver the Site securely and reliably (for example, basic load balancing or security).</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> remember choices you make (if we add preference features).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics (optional):</strong> understand how the Site is used so we can improve it.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing (optional):</strong> measure campaign effectiveness or show relevant messaging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> If we use non-essential cookies (such as analytics or marketing cookies) in jurisdictions where consent is required (including the EEA/UK),
        we will request your consent before setting them.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples of cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The specific cookies used may vary depending on how the Site is hosted and which features are enabled. The list below reflects common
        categories and examples you may encounter.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser controls:</strong> you can block or delete cookies through your browser settings. Note that blocking strictly necessary cookies may impact site functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent (where required):</strong> if we provide a cookie consent tool, you can use it to adjust your preferences at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control</h2>
      <p>
        Some browsers offer “Do Not Track” signals, and some users enable the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). There is no uniform standard for how to
        interpret Do Not Track. If we ever engage in activities that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information under applicable U.S.
        privacy laws, we will take appropriate steps to honor opt-out signals such as GPC where required.
